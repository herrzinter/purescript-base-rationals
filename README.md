# purescript-baseRationals
Little project to play around with purescript. It reimplements some functionality of 
*BaseCalculator* in purescript. 

Namely, you can convert between a string and a rational number in arbitrary basis 
given arbitrary digits. The main point here is, that you can also compute non-fractional 
representations, which are infinit in a certain base, eg. 
* 1/3 ~> 0.[3] in base 10 
* 1/3 ~> or 0.[01] in base 2
